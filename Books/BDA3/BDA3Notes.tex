The formula before eq~1.1 is just the definition of conditional probability in the
continuous case; in the discrete case it takes the form $P\left(A | B\right) = 
P(A \cap B) / P(B)$.  The second step in eq.~1.4 is just this rule being
applied with $|y)$ along for the ride.

The hemophelia discussion also is implicitly assuming that a female with
two affected chromosomes won't survive long enough to have children.
This isn't a terrible assumption, although not entirely true.

If the third son is affected, the calculation becomes
$$
 Pr\left(\theta = 1 | y_1, y_2, y_3\right) = {0.5 \times 0.2 \over 0.5 \times 0.2 + 0 \times 0.8} = 1
$$
